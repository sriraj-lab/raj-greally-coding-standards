# Coding Standards

Basic Raj-Greally lab coding standards/best practices in the context of AI development tools 

- **IF PEOPLE HAVE NO CODING EXPERIENCE, AGENTS ARE OFF LIMITS**

## Startup instructions 

- [ ] Getting started on hpc
- [ ] Getting started LLMs
- [ ] Starter project- 1 week
  - [ ] git
  - [ ] bash commands 
  - [ ] *use hpc basic commands*
  - [ ] *package management*
  - [ ] *run a job*
  - [ ] make a small edit
  - [ ] naming conventions 

## Basic Standards 

- [ ] Starter bashrc
   - basic module load
   - tool paths
   - aliases
 - Bash commands
 - HPC login info stuff
 - SLURM management
 - Start with git
   - .gitignore 

## Algorithmic Development 

- Basic workflows
  - keep seperate contexts for theoretical and technical development
  - Piecemeal buildup with plan and iterative methods
- Unit and smoke tests
- Optimize code based on repo structure
- Use plan mode aggressively
- Package management
  - mamba for creating new environments
  - uv pip for installing specific python packages

## Results/Figure Development

- Marimo

## AI Development

- [ ] Joint Agent/CLAUDE rule set markdown file at the root
  - HPC standardized information
    - HPC sbatch headers
    - Array jobs
  - Reference locations - reference panels, genome etc. 
  - common pipelines (sequencing, global ancestry, local ancestry, ANNOVAR, etc.)
  - Annotations - publicly available databases, instructions on how to call them
  - Common errors: chr1 vs 1
    

- Necessary/recommended MCPs
  - Context7: API calling 
  
- Seperate NOTES/AGENTS.md per project
   - Scripts
   - Paths to inputs
   - Paths to results
   - General debugging tips and information
   - Log of provenance

## Documentation
### Logs
- what was run and what was not
### Notes
- Specific debugging information etc
### Results
- Only experimental details
